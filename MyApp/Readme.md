# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline on AWS EC2 (Tomcat)

This is my first DevOps project where:
- Jenkins will build my code automatically.
- The code will be hosted on an AWS EC2 server.
- Tomcat will be used to serve the web application.

## Learning Goals
1. Understand Jenkins Flow.
2. Deploying to AWS EC2.
3. Automate deployments to Tomcat.

## Technology Stack

- Java (or your programming language)
- Apache Tomcat 10
- Jenkins (for CI/CD)
- GitHub (version control)

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code of the application
- `setup-guide.md` - Step-by-step deployment and setup instructions
- `webapps/` - Tomcat deployment folder (for manual deployment)
- `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` - Build configuration file

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in [`setup-guide.md`](./setup-guide.md) to deploy and run this project.
